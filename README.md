# Motivation
I've been working on github for the most part of my developer life.
While it's a great platform DX wise, it's missing some crucial features to be drop in replacement for other project management tools.
I'm not quite sure where this is leading to yet. The core idea is to add some agile features to github.
In case you got any other ideas feel free to drop them here.

# Goal
**I want this project to get obsolete.**

I think probot is a good way to explore some ideas in that area, but at the end of the day I'd hope for github to implement the good ones inside the core.
